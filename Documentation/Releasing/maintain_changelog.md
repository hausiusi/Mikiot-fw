# How to make a good [changelog?](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

##### Guiding principles
- Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
- There should be an entry for every single version.
- The same types of changes should be grouped.
- Versions and sections should be linkable.
- The latest version comes first.
- The release date of each version is displayed.
- Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

##### Types of changes
- **Added** for new features.
- **Changed** for changes in existing functionality.
- **Deprecated** for soon-to-be removed features.
- **Removed** for now removed features.
- **Fixed** for any bug fixes.
- **Security** in case of vulnerabilities.

##### Additionally
- We provide name of the release under the version if available and sometimes even in advance (under unreleased).
- Each relase is separated by triple hyphens (---) for better readability.
